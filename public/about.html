<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student, I am deeply passionate about technology and its potential to transform lives. I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as C, Java, Python(intermediate) and also in HTML, with a particular emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

  My academic journey has been fueled by a relentless drive to learn and innovate. I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge base. In the future, I aspire to delve into Full Stack Development or Cloud computing, areas that I believe hold immense potential for the future of the tech industry.
  
  I am currently open to opportunities that will allow me to further hone my skills and contribute to exciting technological advancements. Feel free to connect with me for collaborations, opportunities, or tech-related discussions.</p>
